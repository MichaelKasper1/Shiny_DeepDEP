# Shiny_DeepDep
ShinyDeepDep is an R shiny application to access and run deep learning models that predicts the gene dependency profiles of an unscreened cancer cell line (CCL) or impracticable-to-screen tumors based on the baseline genomic profiles. It contains multiple models that process combinations of data types of DNA mutation, gene expression, DNA methylation, and copy number alteration.
